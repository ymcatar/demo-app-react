# react-boilerplate

This is a very minimal boilerplate for kickstarting a React project. Included are:

* webpack
* babel (with es2015 and react presets)
* eslint (for editor plugin only)
* lodash

To start a new react project:
```bash
# Get the repo
git clone https://github.com/ymcatar/react-boilerplate/

# Kickstart a development server (with live-reloading)
npm run dev

# To build a minified build
npm run build
```

If you want something that is not included, please add it yourself or use other boilerplate (there are **literally** millions of them), for example, [this](http://reactboilerplate.com/).
